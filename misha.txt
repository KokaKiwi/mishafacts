Ya-hooo~! It's all over!
Hey!
Oh! Yeah! Shicchan says she's not happy with you ditching us last week.
We were really busy!
She says that only counts for council members. Since you declined, she doesn’t owe you anything.
Actually, I think she's just a little sore that you didn’t spend the day with her.
She's really thankful for your work last week though.
Say, Hicchan, it's still not too late to join up. There's a lot of post-festival paperwork for us to complete…
BWAHAHA! You move fast, don't you Hicchan~? We won't disturb your date any further! Bwahahaha!
Spoilsport.
Pff… pffwa…
Pft-bwahahaha! The lovers return~!
WAHAHAHA~!
The teacher may not have noticed your tardiness, but I did.
I have been instructed to let you off the hook for today, but only on one condition.
You have to help us this afternoon~!
Of course! Doing so could be considered… um, considered…
…under duress and hence would be against regulations.
Things should be done by the book!
It's just that the book hasn't been written for every situation, so there are times when it can be ignored.
This is just insurance, Hisao, insurance~!
Hey, what makes you think you've got time to chat?
Sorry Hanako, but Hisao has to come with us. He's got work to do.
Oh! But you can help too if you'd like.
While we are pleased, nay thrilled, to see how well you've managed to make new friends and forge relationships - and with such a cutie too, Hicchan~…
We nevertheless feel compelled to politely remind you that public displays of affection are strictly forbidden - really? That's disappointing, Shicchan - by section eight of the code of conduct laid out in the student handbook.
In this case, however, ignorance of the law may be your excuse, as we are feeling lenient…
…and the paperwork required to punish the both of you would only add to the already mountainous volume of work which confronts us, the sole members of the Student Council - and besides, you two are adorable together~!
Therefore consider this a formal warning, and please refrain from such displays in the future. At least when Shizune can see you, Hicchan~!
Wahaha~!
Well said, Hicchan~!
Here!
We just came to make sure you're coming along with us to the festival.
Don't renege on your promise~!
Stop trying to get out of it!
C'mon, Hicchan, it'll be fun! You need this, anyway, or you'll become a no-good person!
You don't want to become one of those people who just stays in their dorm room all day, being paranoid, do you?
Really? Ahahaha! Shicchan was worried you would try to get out of it somehow!
We need you, Hicchan~!
I don't have the aim to knock the dolls off their pedestals in that one game… and Shicchan refuses to throw things.
What did you think we meant? I refuse to throw anything.
Why, Shicchan? That is weird…
Well, anyway, Hicchan, you've thrown a ball before, right~, right~? So! You have to come with us!
It is what it is, Hicchan~! It is what it is what it is what it is what it is!
Come on, let's go! The deaf band is setting up outside your window.
Well, we should get something to eat. Hungry, Hicchan?
That's okay, there are other fried foods!
Candy. Junk food is the essence of celebrations!
Wahahahaha!
Come on, I - I mean, Shicchan - will treat you to one thing~!
One?
Just one~! Only so you can build up energy for your throwing arm!
Ah, but it doesn't look like all the booths are done setting up yet, so you might not be able to get what you want.
Come on, Hicchan, the food is already disappearing fast! If you want takoyaki, we need to move now!
I could go for some takoyaki~! Come on, let's eat that!
Eh? Hicchan, you aren't going to eat your food?
I hope you aren't chickening out because it's too hot.
Ahahaha~! Come on, Hicchan, let's go play some games!
No, but it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter~! Come on, Hicchan, before it gets too crowded!
Come on! Come on! The prizes look really great this year, really really~! Wouldn't you like to win some prizes for two cute girls like us?
Misha, stop doing that!
Wait… I'm Misha…
Hicchan, hurry up, you've been holding that piece of takoyaki for like a thousand years!
Hahahahaha!
Well, that takes care of that~! Wahaha! Hahahaha!
You're coming with us! There's a lot to do tonight, you should try harder to enjoy it!
Hahahaha~!
Of course! I didn't know you liked that game, Hicchan!
Are you sure about that, Hicchan~?
Wahahaha~! Okay, okay! We'll see! It should be around here somewhere!
But, where are you going to keep your fish? Do you have a bowl for it?
Maybe he'll eat it!
Hahahahahaha! Ahahahahahaha!!
All right, Hicchan, if we win any fish, we'll give them to you!
Haha~! It was nothing, nothing at all, really~! Yeah, this is great, I think the best festival we've put together yet!
Shiraki, we'd like to play this, that's okay, right?
Of course~, it would be really great if you would just give your cute, hard working Student Council representatives a prize, for all the hours we put in to make all of this possible!
And me!
Me too!
Ah…
You stay out of this, please~!
Ahahaha! Hicchan, where's your sense of chivalry? Besides, I - Shicchan, have a policy against throwing balls!
Ah, sorry, Hicchan. I don't know if my aim is that good, either. You must be pretty good at these things, though, right, right? It shouldn't be a problem for you!
That's not very fair!
Come on, Hicchan, you can knock them down! You have eleven more chances! Go!
Hicchan, congratulations~! What are you going to do with that doll?
Wellllll~ I'll take it, if you don't want it…
Unless you want to keep it for yourself, Hicchan. I didn't know you liked dolls. How delicate.
Can I have it, then?
Hahaha! Trying to win another one? Taking the easy way out, Hicchan?
No thanks~!
Say, Hicchan, can you at least put the doll down while you throw the balls?
There's only one more left, you had better get it! If you fail, I'll kill you~!
What a clever way to duck out of giving me the doll, though! And by me, I mean me~!
Ahahahaha~! Just kidding!
Thank you, Hicchan. Shicchan seems happy, Hicchan~! But, you're going to win one for me, too, right?
Hey, Hicchan, are you okay?
Don't strain yourself. If you're that sick, you'll just make yourself sicker.
Look, the festival is just getting started, and we've been playing games for a while. We can take a little break if you're tired.
Good idea, Shicchan, I'm feeling a little tired too! I think we're all a little worn out, running all over the school, Hicchan!
Hicchan, we're both feeling kinda hungry. How about you?
That's good enough, Hicchan~! So, what should we get to eat?
Ah! How about sandwiches, then? And we'll need something to drink, too! Misha'll get everything!
What?
Hicchan, it's getting kind of crowded, so we might not be able to eat here. It's getting kind of loud, too.
Maybe we should go eat up on the roof.
Okay then! I guess I should get the food and drinks now… So I'll see you two then~!
Ahahahahahahahahaha~! That took awhile! Come on, you two didn't tell me what you wanted, so I got some rice punch, some sandwiches, and some candy, too! A little bit of everything!
So, Hicchan, what do you think of the festival? It's nice, isn't it?
The stars are nice tonight. This couldn't have been a more perfect day.
Like James Bond~!
Wow~! That's a great idea, Shicchan~!
Yup~! Wahaha~!
Wahaha~. Hicchan, are you surprised? Do you want me to point out where you'll be staying?
Hm~, it's no problem, though, Hicchan~! Shicchan and I can share a room if we have to. Well~, unless hers is being used for something else now.
Shicchan says: I should have rearranged my schedule just for you~!
Oh, hi, Hicchan~! You're finally here.
It's more fun to go fishing; we could even make it like a game and try to see who catches the biggest one~! That would be exciting, right? Yeah~! Hicchan, what do you think? It sounds fun, doesn't it?
Shicchan says that she supposes Lilly would prefer to go to the store, right~? It's much less work, so it's natural that she would! Going fishing would be more fun, though, and save money. Akira, you have the right idea~!
Shicchan says that her father's car would be big enough.
Wait, wait~! This is a contest, we need to pick teams first! Shicchan and I will be on one team, of course. Hicchan, you're going to be on our team too, won't you? We can be the Student Council team~!
We can do that now~.
You have the least experience here, Hicchan~.
This is a freshwater body of water, you marine biologist~.
Hmm~, you don't want to fish with your own sister?
Shicchan, I think he's upset that he's stuck with the backup rod~!
Hi hi~! Guess who~!
Hicchan, no spoilers! Don't spoil it, don't ruin the surprise, okay~?
Bingo~! That's right! But~, it was too easy, somehow.
Too many people can tell it's me! I want to surprise someone! I thought for sure that Hideaki would be fooled~. Why weren't you, hm~?
Really? Wahaha~!
Hideaki, are you giving Hicchan trouble? You should have taken him somewhere more exciting! The park is too close to home, Shicchan says you're lazy~.
Hicchan isn't a tax collector's boy, I think~. Hicchan, what do your parents do? You never told us~!
Aah~…
That was delicious~! Shicchan and I are done now. Hicchan, you are too, right~? We should get going!
Unbelievable~! It's like I'm really watching an interrogation~! This is not a cop show! Guests definitely have responsibilities, but hasn't he ever heard of being a gracious host~? Really~!
Wahaha~. Don't take it too hard, Hicchan~! Shicchan's dad does this to everyone, I think it's like a joke~.
Hicchan, let's go shopping!
It works out perfectly~! Come on, Hicchan~!
Really, Hicchan~? Hm… If you really want Shicchan's attention, you can tell me, and then I can tap her on the shoulder for you.
Like this~!
Over here~! Hi, Hicchan~! Hi, Mr. Shicchan's-father~! Hi, Hideaki~!
Hehehe~! What do you think, Hicchan?
Aw~… Hicchan, you look disappointed, you don't like it either?
Aw, thanks, Hicchan~!
Ahahahaha~! Really? Thanks, Mr. Shizune's-dad~!
Hm~? I don't understand~! Okay, okay okay~! I'll call you Mr. Hakamichi!
What? Shouting~? I'm not shouting~!
Ow~! My ears hurt~!
Wahaha~, really, Hicchan? That's funny!
Hicchan, you're so persistent. Suddenly being interested in sign language again… could it be that Hicchan wants to make a career out of it? That's not fair, that was my idea first~!
You should be careful, Hicchan. Times change too quickly~… By the time I decided I wanted to be a sign language interpreter, they had cell phones that people could type out whole paragraphs on. Amazing~! Not very good for me, though!
I'm sorry, Hicchan, I'm just so~ tired~! Especially lately, even though being with Shicchan is fun, she has way more energy than me! Teaching on top of that would be too~ tiring; I don't have that much stamina! Sorry~!
Actually~, Shicchan and I were planning on going shopping today! It's our last chance to pick up some souvenirs.
Yeah, right, right~! I hope not!
Hicchan, now I'm kind of worried. But~, souvenirs! So~!, some other time, Hicchan. Aha hahaha~. Do you want us to get you something, too?
Heheheh~.
Hicchan, you're up early~! Am I interrupting a conversation?
What~? But Shicchan, I already cut out so many of them…
Shicchan, they don't look very cute, though~…
That only comes into play if they learn anything from it, Hicchan~! If they don't, I'll be hyper mad~! If they turn out to be the flaky type, I'll definitely be hard on them~.
Ahaha~. Hicchan, there are no candidates yet~!
Hicchan, I'll be discouraged if we don't have any replacements when I have to go~! Shicchan says.
But~!, it isn't like the school will stop running without a Student Council. It will be harder for them to hand out forms, though~!
Hahaha~.
Do they really think it's such an easy job that they can do everything at the last minute and just coast into the role~? Insulting~! Really~, really~!
They're going to be eaten alive once they have to sit at this tiny desk and see just how much work they have to do~!
Wahaha~! We should make them funny-looking this time, then, so no one will take them! How about that, Shicchan~?
A dinner just for us~? Yay~! It's like a little party, Shicchan~!
Hi, Hicchan~!
I know that, Hicchan~! Shicchan is somewhere else, I guess~!
Ahahaha~. We aren't stuck together, Hicchan~.
Do you want one, Hicchan~?
I have another one in my bag~! I was prepared, see~, see~? I'm just like Shicchan~!
Wahaha~!
Really~, Hicchan? Ahaha~. Buy me lunch sometime, then, okay~? Then~!, we'll be even.
Yeah~ yeah~! I'm really hungry today, Hicchan! Thanks!
Hmmm~. I want to go to the teahouse, they have a really big parfait there.
No no no~! This one is really, really~ big! It's also really expensive~!
Hahaha~! A little~…
Hicchan, I don't think I ever did that~. Are you sure it wasn't just Shicchan?
Aren't you going to order anything, Hicchan~? If you're hungry, we can share.
You can pick it out~!
Mm~. Parfaits are the best~, I have sensitive teeth, so ice cream is a no-no~. Cake is too soft, though, and if there is too much icing, I get bored. Parfait is interesting.
How many cafés have parfaits here~? I think, ten! I've tried them all, I like this one the best. It has a little flan~!
Not just dessert~! I want to eat all kinds of delicious things~.
Someday, I'll have enough money to buy a two kilogram Matsusaka beef steak~!
I guess so~! …Decadent~?
I don't know what that means.
Wahaha~!
Hicchan, you're too wordy.
Hahaha~. I think that is what Shicchan likes about you.
Wahaha~! No, not like that, Hicchan~!
Shicchan's been busy because of the elections~!
Hicchan, do you think that Shicchan is avoiding you?
Is that so~…
No, of course not, Hicchan~! But~! …It's frustrating, sometimes~. Shicchan has so much energy, and is always trying to make people feel as excited about things as she is~.
But it's like Shicchan doesn't know how to handle things when everyone gets really hyped up. Or~! I think that she wants to make sure nothing goes wrong. When I want to help out, Shicchan always pushes me away.
It's frustrating.
I'm just overthinking it, probably~! Right~?
Ow~! Hot~ hot~ hot~… thought it would have cooled down by now~!
I feel tired when it gets dark, Hicchan~.
Ahahaha~.
Done~!
Not a sundae; It's a parfait, Hicchan.
Wahaha~.
Hi, Hicchan~!
Hicchan~! Were you talking to yourself?
Ahaha~! That's okay~! Don't be embarrassed, Hicchan; I do it too, sometimes, when I'm alone! La~ la~ la~.
We had lunch together~! Strictly business, a business lunch~!
Ahaha~! It's nothing~, nothing~. It's normal for one part of the Student Council to not know what the other is doing~!
You can~! Isn't that great~? Ahaha~! Aren't you happy? Yay~ yay~!
Hicchan~! Since you're here, you can help me put them up!
Shicchan had a really good idea~! We can put some flyers inside books, too~! Then, even if they try to ignore us, they won't be able to! They could even be spring loaded!
I liked it~.
A super ultra aggressive marketing blitz~! We're going to start going door to door, too~!
Hicchan~! You think every idea is terrible…
Wahaha~! Hicchan, that sounds like a challenge. Mutiny~, mutiny~!
Wahaha~! It was just a joke~!
Aha~ ha~ ha~.
Hi~! Hi, hi!
…
Hicchan~! You're here, too~!
If it opens, someone is inside~.
Wahaha~!
Am I interrupting~?
Great~! That's really great~! But~! I was sure I would be. Is this a break?
Wahaha~! Yeah~! That's right, Hicchan!
That sounds fun~.
Hm~ hm~, that sounds fun, Hicchan! And, I am a little hungry…
Shicchan, you promised we would have a student council thing, just for us, right~? Right, right~! This can be it~!
Hi, Hicchan~!
You don't look happy to see me~…
Nope~. I just thought I'd follow you back, Hicchan~!
Yeah~, thanks, Hicchan!
Hicchan…
Did you make Shicchan sad?
When I went to the office today, Shicchan couldn't hear me coming. That's why~, when I opened the door, I saw a really confusing expression on her face. Shicchan looked happy and sad, and~ I wanted to know why.
Hm~… When I asked Shicchan about it, she said that it was okay~!
Chocolate milk is important.
Wahaha~. You're right~.
But~! I don't want Shicchan to lie to me to make me feel better.
Hahaha~! Most people don't know how serious Shicchan is and think she's just putting on a show. I'm happy that you understand her, Hicchan.
Really~? What did she say?
Well~, if someone tells you that they have a secret, you can sort of call that a secret by itself, Hicchan~!
It can be!
Wahaha~!
Why, Hicchan?
Hicchan, are you thinking something dirty?
Ahahaha~.
If you are, it's okay, I think.
I feel sad, Hicchan.
It's funny, the happier Shicchan gets, the more depressed I feel. Even though I should be happy for Shicchan. I still am… But~, I can't talk about my problems with her.
Just like Shicchan can't talk about her problems to me. It's the same thing, Hicchan. If we have that kind of problem, then I'm not sure any more what I should do. I wonder… if I'm a bad friend.
…
Do you like me, Hicchan?
Hello, Hicchan~! Are you feeling well?
Since you're a new student, we've been cutting you some slack. Please don't expect this kind of task-dodging to be allowed in the future.
While your contribution to class 3-2's stall is appreciated—
—we would prefer your efforts to be focused on the task at hand. Namely, your own class.
Did you enjoy the festival, then~?
Hicchan~.
Hicchan~.
Come on, Hicchan~.
See Hicchan, even Shicchan wants you to get up~!
Geez, Hicchan, I'll just have to wake…
…you…
Wahahahahaha~!
Wahahahahahaha~!
Who was the one who slept in class, Hicchan~?
Poor Shicchan was having a fit trying to wake you up. Weren't you?
Shicchan wanted to give you the handouts the substitute teacher gave out while Hicchan was sleeping.
Shicchan says she forgives you now, Hicchan~!
Wahahahaha~!
Oh, Shicchan also says that you should check your student mail more often~!
Hi, Hicchan~! Hi~ hi~!
Hicchan, that's rude~! We came to pick you up!
Did you think we thought you were going to escape and came to make sure you didn't? Surely not, Hicchan~!
It's time for student council work, yes it is~!
Aren't you happy, Hicchan, to be able to help the whole~ school~! You are like, a hero~! The future generations will tell stories of this day!
Hm~? What is it, Shicchan?
Yeah, this is Hicchan's room~! We haven't seen it before, I didn't even realize!
It's kinda plain, but Hicchan hasn't had time to decorate it yet, isn't that so~?
What are those?
Really? What are you hiding, Hicchan~?
Is that so~?
Okay~! Then, we'll wait, and become better and better friends, and one day when you feel like it, you can tell us about it~!
Yup~!
No no no~! Now!
Hahaha~! It's for the common good, so we sacrifice our math lessons, and maybe the social studies too~!
Awesome, Hicchan~! You said it, okay? Remember: “I'm fine with helping out~,” that's what you said, right~?
Okay~! Are you ready to go then? We can go to the office together~!
Don't be silly, Hicchan.
We've never walked to school together, Hicchan~.
Hahaha~! That's great, Hicchan~! Okay, okay, but first~! You had a really great idea, Shicchan liked it a lot… So~! it's time for a game!
Shicchan is holding a 1000-yen note in one hand, Hicchan~! If you guess which one, you can have it! If you don't…
You're carrying all our books to school~! Right, Shicchan~? Right~!
Okay, Hicchan~! Get ready~!
Really~, Hicchan? It doesn't look like it's nothing to me.
What a long line of bottles, right~? Right~! What are all of those, Hicchan?
That looks like a lot more than “just a few things”…
What does that mean, Hicchan? When someone sees something interesting, their first instinct is to ask what it is, that's obvious. What's wrong with that?
Hicchan, I think Shicchan is just concerned.
But…
Okay, Hicchan, we'll leave you alone.
Psst! Where were you?
Come on, tell us! Shicchan is very interested too!
Hi, Hicchan~! Good morning~!
A question? Hm~… Okay, Hicchan~! Sure~ sure~! I have time, but only because I'm late!
Haha~. I should have woken up earlier, but I was so tired~… if I had, I would have to study, but since I didn't, it won't hurt~! What is it, Hicchan?
Yup~! They're electives! Why do you want to know, Hicchan?
Hm~? Ah, well, Hicchan, I've heard there are fewer and fewer students taking sign language every year. So! If you want to, I'm sure they will let you in~!
Are you thinking of learning sign language, Hicchan?
If you learned sign language, Hicchan, that would make Shicchan really happy~. If you want, we can go to the teachers' office after school. They'll probably let you in.
Why not?
Aw~. You're right, Hicchan. Still, this will be hard~… It's such good news…
Wahaha~!
You're right, Hicchan~!
Hi, Hicchan~!
It's a surprise to see you here, Hicchan! …Ah, that's right! You're taking sign language, aren't you~? Right~!
What do you think of it so far, Hicchan?
Haha~! Really, Hicchan?
Hm~… I agree~!
Okay~!
Hicchan, you're behind? That's not good at all!
Okay, Hicchan, let's review what you learned, then~! I'll tutor you, okay~?
Aw…
I want to be a sign language teacher, Hicchan! But~, it would really be great if I could try tutoring someone in it, first. Even if it's for a little while, the experience would be valuable.
Hahaha~! It's the reason why I wanted to go to this school, Hicchan!
It's also really expensive to attend here, you know. Because I want to be a sign language teacher, I have reduced tuition fees. If it wasn't for that, I don't know if I'd be able to keep going here.
You're right, Hicchan, you're smart.
Ahahaha~! Really? Okay~! Okay okay okay~! Yay~! Thanks, Hicchan~! I'll do my best!
Let's start right now~!
I miss Shicchan~…
But it's hard to talk to her in class, Hicchan! There's no Student Council today, either~.
When it's back, you're not going to skip out, right, Hicchan?
Shicchan takes the Student Council very seriously, Hicchan. Now that you've joined, she works harder than before since she wants to make a good impression.
Some other people joined, at first, but they stopped coming soon after. Shicchan tried to get more people interested in the Student Council but wasn't successful.
Even when someone would join, they'd stop coming eventually. They'd make excuses and just put it off more and more until they stopped coming altogether.
However… I believe that you really mean it, Hicchan.
When you said you would join, she was really happy.
Shicchan thinks you're interesting, Hicchan. An uninteresting person won't have the drive needed to join. Even if they do, a person that isn't interesting will quit soon after.
That's what Shicchan said.
So~! It's my duty to make sure you keep going~!
Really, Hicchan? That's the first time anyone has said that about me~! Wahahaha~!
Okay, Hicchan, let's review what you learned in class today~!
Hm~, you're right, Hicchan~! Okay, let's start with the basics, then~! I'll just teach you everything from the beginning~!
Huh~?
It's like riding a bike, Hicchan~! You never forget the basics! Wahaha~!
I don't know how to ride a bike, though~…
Right, right~. I want to be a teacher one day, so of course I know what I'm doing… Okay~! Okay okay okay~! We're starting~!
Uh…
…Mmm~…
Ahahaha~…
Um… Sign language was formally introduced in the 18th century by a Frenchman named… ah… whose name I can't pronounce, and he started the first public school for the deaf in 1755, but the unwritten history of sign language is said to…
I don't really know where to start. Sorry~… Well~, what better place to start than the history of sign language? Right~? Right~!
No, wait, maybe the alphabet. Okay~, the alphabet it is, then!
Okay, Hicchan~! This is pretty basic stuff, although some people think that this is all of signing, and forget there are all kinds of specific gestures and words.
Although you can't really get anywhere else without the basics! This is A. Do you see it? Now, you try!
Hahaha! Yeah, that's it!
Now, this is B, and this is C.
And now D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, VWXY 'n' Z~!
Of course not, Hicchan~!! Come on, I'll do it again! A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K… Your turn~!
What are you talking about, Hicchan? Come on, sign, sign~!
No, like this!
This~!
I wish Shicchan was here, this would be so much easier with her. Hahaha, that's how sign language is taught most of the time, anyway, with two instructors~! Did you know that, Hicchan?
Hicchan~! Are you paying attention?
Shicchan says that sign language is different from any other, because you have to think about everything before you say it. That means every word has more weight, Hicchan. Every single one is more important than normal.
So~, pay attention, please.
Student Council~!
Yup~!
Hahaha~!
It's boring playing against each other so much, Hicchan. So, it's your turn, okay? Okay~! It's settled then~!
Hicchan, this is one of the last days we'll be able to take it easy like this for a while. So~, it's especially important that we make the most of it, don't you think?
Tanabata will be coming up soon, and we'll have to put in a lot of work for that, too.
So, for now, play with us~!
Hahaha~! Yay~! Hicchan agrees~! Let's celebrate!
Let's play a game to celebrate, Hicchan~!
Hicchan is worried about the stakes~.
How very Japanese, putting the consequences above everything else.
Hicchan, have you ever heard of the expression “missing the forest for the trees?”
Hicchan is so vengeful~, even though it was just a playful little joke. If an armadillo bit you, you would probably bite back!
It's foolish to bite an armadillo back, Hicchan!
But Hicchan would do it anyway, you see~! Hahaha!
Hicchan, we didn't have anything planned at all if you were to win or lose, you just assumed there would be something like that~.
Hm~, me too~! But, oh well~! There isn't. Does that change your mind, Hicchan?
Yay yay~! Let's start right now~!
…
…
Checkers?
Okay okay~! Hicchan, how about… Monopoly?
Luck is kind of a skill, you know.
It can be if you're consistently lucky~! Right~?
Hm~, hm~ hm~ hm~~. Baccarat? Marbles? Life? Snakes and Ladders? Roulette? Blackjack? Paper football? Trivial Pursuit?
Three way chess?
Yes yes~, let's try it, definitely~! Ahahahaha~!
You're in our class, aren't you, right? Right~! So~! Don't be so timid, okay? Come on!
Yup, even though we're your seniors, it's not like we'll bite!
What is it you said you want? An ID card, right~? Right~!
Do you like chess?
You like chess, don't you~? Yeah, you do, definitely~!
Do~{w=0.2} you~{w=0.2} want~{w=0.2} to~{w=0.2} play~?
We're having our lunch break, so you'll have to wait anyway. Why not play with us in the meantime~? Come on, it'll be fun, really fun~! You like chess, don't you? I can tell, really really, it's obvious, so~! Please~, will you?
Wahaha~! Yay~! Success, success, okay okay okay~! That's great~!
That was a really good game~!
It was really close~, I thought I would lose. You're very skilled.
This is a fun game, but it took so long. Almost the whole period!
Chess is too formulaic, especially at this level. How about some advanced rules~?
Yeah, yeah~! Like speed chess, or chess with additional pieces, or maybe we can pair up and play tag team chess, with one or two boards, your choice! C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon it'll be fun, really, really~! Regular chess is so slow, too methodical, it's boring.
I want to play chess that rewards quick thinking, and daring! Any one of these, comparing chess to it is like comparing checkers to go, or tic-tac-toe to shogi, right? Right~!
Wahahaha~! Even laser chess might be more exciting, pick something, pick~!
Let's change the rules and play again~! Best out of six, like Kasparov and Deep Blue~!
Huh? Wait!
Ah, didn't she want to know where she could get a new ID? Excuse me! Hello~? Come back, please! Wait, wait~! Wait~!
I couldn't catch her~…
There, there~!
Ahahaha~!
Hicchan, do you hate games where luck is involved?
“I don't like games that revolve around luck of the draw,” right? That was you, Hicchan~.
That girl isn't very good at chess.
Chess is a formulaic game. So~! It's a game that isn't suited for her… There was nothing formulaic about her. Someone who plays chess like that, looking only at the next piece, playing so shallowly, can't be called a serious chess player.
Anyone who loves chess to the point where their eyes sparkle like that when they see a chessboard would be the kind of person who would study the game.
If you study it just casually, you can learn to see at least two moves ahead, even against pros.
Why would someone who loves the game so much… with that enthusiasm… know so little about it? Even less than someone with just a passing interest in it?
Her feelings are real, but her feelings for the game aren't real. Do you understand, Hicchan~?
There is no luck in chess~! It's very important to realize that. Luck in games is good because it gives everyone a chance. Just enough to matter, but not so much that skill is penalized. Chess is boring because it's not a game; to me, it seems like formulas.
Hanako isn't the kind of person who would love something like that either~.
If you value something, you fight. Struggle is proof of precs— preciousness? I think so, at least. Or~! You concede immediately~! Since it's so precious that it stops your thinking. The first is a passionate love. The second is a gentle love.
I tried to fight her, chasing around her king, and trying to bait her. I didn't succeed though, because she stuck to only what would work.
The trickiest moments were when she moved the fastest. That means she knew exactly how to deal with those situations.
That means someone taught her. Do you understand, Hicchan~?
If you love chess that much, but you can't give it your all, it's because you love the memories attached to it and not the game; it's too precious to her to see as a tool for true competition.
Due to that, you can't become friends over it. Not without words.
Thanks again, Hicchan~!
Hicchan, we might have to help out with building stalls again starting tomorrow.
Yup! That's right~! Even though Hicchan wasn't there for it~.
It wouldn't have made sense to bore you with making you clean up right after the festival, it would have ruined the fun.
Ahahaha~! Hicchan is lazy anyway, you would have tried to run away again~! Shicchan doesn't like playing foxhound.
Hm~, that's a good question, though, Hicchan.
Stalls~!
Because~! the school doesn't have anywhere to store that many stalls, Hicchan.
Ah, yeah yeah~, right, they do, but they don't want to pay~! Sorry, Shicchan~…
Okay~!!
Hicchan, let's eat something~! It feels like we've been working all day~…
Ahahaha~! It was like that today because they had some especially interesting things for sale on the side.
Hmmmmm? Why can't you do it yourself?
I can't tell Shicchan that, then.
Because~! You have a stake in this, so I can't trust you~! If Shicchan wants to reply, she has to let go of the bread, and then you win. Who knows, who knows, maybe that's what you want, Hicchan?
It wouldn't be fair, so I'm going to be neutral! Like Switzerland~!
Do you know about Switzerland?
Hicchan! Drop the bread! We are negotiating now!
Ah~! Haha~! Don't mind me, I don't even really like veal. I'll just take this sandwich right here~! And something to drink, too…
You're so immature, Hicchan. Why don't you pick the chicken katsudon bread instead? It's delicious~!
Hicchan~! Why are you so obsessed with eating the veal cutlet bread, spe—ci—fi—cal—ly?
You're acting like a kid, Hicchan.
That doesn't matter: we'll play for it instead~!
We'll play Rock, Paper, Scissors.
Really? That sounds so serious, Shicchan…
This looks like fun, can I play?
Hahahaha~!
It's a duel, Shicchan?
Eh~, dueling conduct? Hm~… You're right, you're right~! I really don't know…
Enough of this, Hicchan~! I see what I have been doing wrong, this will all be over in the next round, so brace yourself, okay~? Okay~!
I have studied your thought processes and~ I see how you play. I'm anticipating your next move and will combat it expertly.
Hicchan~… That was very romantic, I think.
Wahahahahaha~!
Guess who~!
Wahahaha~! It's me, Hicchan~!
Then why did you say it was Shicchan~? It's okay to be wrong sometimes, Hicchan~! You're too proud.
Anyway~, after Student Council, you don't usually have any plans, right~? So, you're just going to go straight to your dorm?
Okay, that's great~! That's great, Hicchan~! I wanted to talk to you today, so this works out perfectly!
Hm? Oh! Actually~… I'm a little behind in some of my classes, and if I don't catch up, it could be a problem~! I can't put it off any longer.
My teachers say that I have to really start taking things seriously, so I should listen, especially~ because this is the third time.
Sorry~! I'm sorry, Hicchan.
I won't be able to help you or Shicchan with Student Council for a few days~. It'll only be for two or three days, really! I'll definitely try and come back as soon as possible! But~…
Really? Thank you, Hicchan~! Really~! Yay yay~! I didn't know Hicchan would take it so well~! I thought you would be worried, with how there's going to be so~ much work, with Tanabata coming up and everything~!
…But~! Hicchan is so composed~! I'm glad~…
Hicchan, just tell Shicchan that you can use sign language too! I don't understand why you won't.
That won't be a problem, Hicchan~!
Well~, because I… kind of… told Shicchan that you could understand her. She was worried about the same thing, that you wouldn't be able to understand each other~! So~! I was worried, but it worked out fine in the end after all~!
Hahaha?
…But, Hicchan, I think this is definitely for the best~!
Yes~!
Hicchan~!
Don't forget, you said you would help out with building stalls today~! Behind the school after classes are over, okay~?
Last time you helped out, Hicchan, we really appreciated it~! This time, it's even more important, so skipping out is unforgivable, okay?
Because, Hicchan, a festival that celebrates a town is exactly what it sounds like. It's to celebrate your home and its history.
Tanabata is different, it's for wishes and lovers~! That definitely makes it more important, doesn't it? Yeah~, naturally, it would be~.
Hicchan, you have no sense of fun…
You have to appreciate things like that, even if it's just an excuse to eat interesting things and dress up in the end~!
I'll be disappointed in you if you don't, okay?
Hi, Hicchan~!
I'm done making up all my work~! Just in time~, I won't have to miss the festival. Wahaha~.
If they really really tried to enforce that, you would pull me out on student council business~?
No it isn't, Hicchan~!
Shicchan says that if there were only two Student Council members overseeing the festival, it would be a problem, wouldn't it? Yeah~, definitely! It has to be at least three! It's for the good of everyone, it's perfectly reasonable, it's necessary~!
Hahaha~.
Hicchan, you and Shicchan talk to each other much more now~! Back and forth, it's really funny too! Like an old married couple, right~ right~?
Wahaha~! Hicchan! It's not like that~.
You're so considerate, Hicchan! Shicchan is sorry~ and apologizes.
Hicchan~! Usually, having to make up work isn't something to celebrate over.
Where should we go?
Wahaha~! Hicchan, you're a part of this team, too!
Yeah yeah~! You are, Hicchan!
So~! Where do you think we should go?
Hi~! But~! you don't have to do that all the time if it's just us.
But—
Okay~! Okay~! If you say so, Yuuko! Hahahahaha~!
Hahaha~! Hicchan sounds like an old man~!
Are you going to wear a yukata tomorrow, Hicchan?
I'll dress up this time~! You'll see, Hicchan!
Not just Shicchan, but me too~!
Maybe~ I'll change my hairstyle, too.
Yuuko~, they make you work on holidays? Awwww…
I've never really celebrated Tanabata before, or dressed up for anything like this~! I'll finally be able to wear my yukata. Yay yay~!
Hm~… last year, Shicchan, me, and the 3-2 class rep ran a stall for the festival! It was a soba stall, I think~? Yeah, it was~! Yup!
Shicchan cooked, and Lilly took the orders, and I translated for them~!
Shicchan kept saying, “It's so inefficient~! Misha~! Why do you have to be the middleman? As in~, why is there a middleman in the first place? Huh~? It would be fine if I did the cooking and you took orders! It doesn't make sense at all!”
But~! I think everyone had fun in the end. Right, Shicchan~?
It was the old Student Council's idea~! That's why~!
At universities and some private schools, student councils can have control over millions of yen to budget and distribute as needed! Wow~! Really? Millions? Ah, right~! And they are much more involved in school activities, too, Hicchan!
This school's Student Council was like a joke in comparison~! Don't give people positions of power if they don't have any power at all! What's the point~?
…I wanted us to have more and more work~! It was hard to convince the school and the other Student Council members to allow it. Actually~, a lot of the work you've seen us do really is work that I took on, which is what Lilly was talking about.
If it wasn't for Shicchan, the Student Council would just file attendance reports day in and day out~!
Hahaha~! Would you prefer that, Hicchan?
Of course, Hicchan, as soon as the workload started going up, most of the Student Council stopped coming.
Wahahaha~!
Okay~! Then, Student Council is ad—jour—ned? for today~!
It has to be adjourned excitingly, because today was a good day.
Ahahaha~!
Hicchan!
Hi, Hicchan! Good morning~!
I could ask you the same thing, Hicchan! What are you doing up so early? I didn't expect to find you here~!
Hm~… you're right. Wahaha~!
You sound just like Shicchan.
Of course, Hicchan~! I don't like celebrations, or maybe not as much as Shicchan does, but Tanabata stands always have interesting things to buy and all kinds of seasonal food. And~! I get to wear a yukata~!
What about you, Hicchan~?
Ahaha~! Hicchan, you're not that logical~! So~! That's really surprising! Hm, okay, though. I was just making sure, because you didn't look like you were having a lot of fun last time. Me and Shicchan were a little worried, because of that.
Really, Hicchan~? Wahahaha~! What part of it? Tell me~!
Aw~… I always fall asleep early. But~! I won't sleep through them this year! I'll definitely stay awake!
Hahahahahaha~! Maybe I will~! That's a great idea, Hicchan!
Wahaha~. You make it sound like you would like that, Hicchan.
Hicchan~! Do you like Shicchan?
Ahahaha~! Really, Hicchan? Hm~! No, you're kidding, right? You must like Shicchan more.
But you almost called her Shicchan! So~! I'm right, right~?
Wahaha~!
Maybe~.
I'm hungry. Did you eat breakfast, Hicchan?
Hm…
We should eat something, then~! Do you think they will be serving breakfast today?
Hey, Hicchan, have you ever heard about those vending machines that you can get food from, like burgers, soup, and even pizza? Wouldn't it be great if we had some of those at our school~?
Imagine how cool it would be if we had machines like that at our school, Hicchan~! It would almost be like magic, wouldn't it?
Hot food coming out of a vending machine, that's so amazing, I could never imagine that. Seeing one of those machines would be like a dream!
Hm~… We don't have machines like that in this whole town, though~. It's too early to even go into town~! I won't be able to eat breakfast, Hicchan, that's the most important meal of the day. Everyone says so~! Ah, I want to eat!
Hicchan, a soda is not a breakfast. It's like water~.
…
Okay. Ahahahaha~!
Hicchan~! How're you?
Thanks, Hicchan~!
Hicchan, you're a little late. We were waiting here a while for you, did you forget the time or the place?
Oh well~! Let's get going, Hicchan~!
Hahaha~! Either way, Hicchan, we have to walk into town and then back up if we want to see everything. So~! This way, after we're done, we'll be right by our dorms when we're tired. It works out perfectly~!
What do you want to do first, Hicchan~?
I thought you didn't like games, Hicchan.
Hicchan, you're going to win a doll for me too this time, right~?
Snow cones! Hicchan, do you want one~?
Hicchan~, what flavor do you want?
Shicchan never makes wishes, Hicchan!
I know~!
Hicchan, do you want me to tell you?
Wahaha~! I'll tell you later, okay?
Actually, I feel tired. I think I'm going to go to bed early~.
But~! it has, Hicchan. Maybe I can visit Yuuko first, then go back? Or~… I don't know~.
Well, it doesn't matter. Have fun without me, okay~?
'Afternoon, Hicchan~!
Shicchan wants to know if you'd like to have lunch with us today~?
Thank you~!
What are you faying, Hiffan~! We mon't hafe any uffer mofiffe~.
Nope!
Nuh-uh!
That's it, Hicchan~! You got it~!
Shicchan says you shouldn't be so suspicious of us~. She's just doing her duty as a class representative, after all~.
It's the class representative's job to ensure everybody's doing all right in class, isn't it~?
So this is the thanks we get for giving you companionship during lunchtime?
Lilly's away and Hanako is absent, and since those two are the only people you hang around with…
You also made it kind of obvious to see~…
Hey Hicchan, is your juice past its expiry date?
You were pulling a weird face, like this~.
Oh?
The only people she's ever talked to for more than a sentence or two are you and Lilly.
There are a couple of things we know about Hanako as Student Council members, thanks to the records that pass through our hands, but we can't say anything about what's in them.
Don't worry about it, Hicchan~. It happens every year, after all~.
Everyone has problems they have to deal with, right, Hicchan?
Hicchan, if we can help at all…
Hi~ hi~!
Hi, Hicchan~!
Look, it's the class representative~! Hello~!
Of course, you're not the representative of this class, right, right~?
You were here even earlier than us!
Class rep~! It's a good thing you're here~! We have to talk.
The festival is coming up in three days, right? Every other class has already handed in their projected budget reports for their events! Even the first-years! Except you~!
Wahaha~!
Today! The deadline is today! You're certainly taking your time, aren't you? If I had it my way, I'd have had all of the necessary paperwork days ago, but someone~! had to say “the deadline, please extend it~!”
Do you want to know what's harder than distributing the funds for one class' event? Handling the same matter for every class in the school and then some~! The one who does that is me!
Then~! Can I have it, please?
It was your responsibility~! A budget report isn't something you should just be delegating away; as class rep, it's your job to be on top of things! This kind of disregard for proper procedure is really just terrible~!
Okay~!
Lilly, don't they live here at the school? That's a five minute walk, you know~.
What could they possibly have that prevents them from taking five minutes out of their busy lives… to drop off something that will affect the enjoyment of their entire class?
And what's with that attitude~? I said that it's not something you should be delegating away; are you the class representative or aren't you?
Tell me the names of those two students, they should have your job if you can't even handle something this simple yourself.
Of course, you do so much, class rep~! It must be so difficult being you~!
Are you accusing me of slacking off? It seems like you're confusing me with yourself~!
You're right, the difference between us is like heaven and hell.
Hicchan~! Don't you slack off either~!
Aren't you taking part in the festival, Hicchan? You are, aren't you? Then~! I hope you're going to do a lot more to make sure it goes smoothly than this person~!
What are you saying, Hicchan?
Are you saying I'm wrong?
Hicchan, you want too much~! But~! You have a point. Okay, okay okay~! You're not lazy, Hicchan.
Hahaha~!
That's good! If you're not useless, you shouldn't let anyone say you are~! But the next time I say it, it'll really be because you are disappointing me like Miss Class Rep here, so don't let this go to your head!
Class rep~! Shicchan says: “Don't forget that report, please~!”
Yup~!
It's true, Shicchan, just a little~.
Hahaha~! Shicchan thinks you should mind your own business.
Hicchan, we have a few last minute things to take care of before class~! We might be late, so~! Can you please cover for us?
Perfect~! Yay~! Okay~! Thanks, Hicchan!
Excuses, excuses. Miss Class Rep has had plenty of time to deal with her report.
And we repeatedly offered you a position to help with the student council work, but you refused to commit yourself to making the festival a success.
What are you doing, Hicchan~?
Aw~, really? But it's all in the book… That's why no one else is copying it down~!
Why are you so quiet, Hicchan? It's hard to hear you.
Huh?
Uwaaah! I'm so tired!
Well, we're in the Student Council, you know, so we're pretty busy.
Huh?
Hahaha~! But, Hicchan, some could say the work is too much.
It'd be nice if students were to show a little more support for their leadership, some appreciation to the ones who are working so hard to make it all possible.
Maybe, for example, a little help. That's asking too much, is it? Yep~! Help would be appreciated~! From students like you~!
If students would show their dedication and school spirit, and offer some help, well, I don't exactly need it…
But I wouldn't necessarily refuse it… So~! it would be nice if someone would…
Oh? Hello~!
Hey! Playing delinquent again?
Sorry, Satou is not here. She, eh, came by in the morning though.
If she has any sense in her head, she's in her classroom, working on their festival project. But who knows where that woman is loitering at.
She might be slacking off somewhere, just like Hicchan~! Wahaha~!
She might be slacking off somewhere~! What a useless woman~!
But Hicchan is not useless, right? Right? He said so himself~! Wahaha~!
I think Shicchan is saying that you should help us, Hicchan~!
But~! that's the intent, so, please? I can't keep up, we have to actually build stalls for the festival, almost all of them all by ourselves, can you believe that?
Hammering boards together, over and over again, for hours, it's really hard!
I'm so used to it I was doing swinging motions in class, and I didn't even know it!
It's so repetitive, I can't stand it! And yesterday, I actually hammered all the boards on top of each other…
It was just a stack of boards all nailed together, and then I had to take it apart and do it all over again, and I got yelled at and laughed at~!
So…
Do you have any plans for today, Hicchan?
I wonder if you do~.
Really~?
You're going to help us, right?
It didn't seem like you were in any rush to get to the library, Hicchan~!
That's right, Shicchan~, it does seem like he was probably going to slack off for the rest of the day.
Hahaha~! Wahaha~! You're surrounded~!
Let's go to the student council room~!
I'm sorry, Hicchan, I feel bad, but this works out for everyone, right?
That's right, Shicchan! Yes~, that's a good point too.
Yes, this is beneficial to everyone, it solves all our problems.
Yeah yeah~!, I also thought he'd be more appreciative of our efforts.
Come on, we have a lot of work to do! Let's go to the student council room~!
Deja vu~?
Hahaha, you know, my horoscope said it'd be a good day for me today.
And now that you're going to help—{w=.5}{nw}
Right~!, I mean, now that you've decided to help us, completely of your own free will, I'll be able to take it easy! Lucky~, huh?
That wasn't very nice, there. Hahaha, you really got us good, though. Didn't he, Shicchan?
Right, right… …Hahaha!
What was that about? I thought you said you'd help us!
And then you bailed on us! And you thought you would get away with it, didn't you?
Oh, ah… Yeah~, you thought you could get away with it! But, a criminal always returns to the scene of the crime!
Not very bright, are you, criminal? Thinking you can just shirk your duties like that… How low, Hicchan~!
That's for the courts to decide, criminal! I don't think we have to tell you that!
Besides, you're the criminal here, you know what you did!
No, what's that, Hicchan~? What does that have to do with this?
Hicchan, what does that have to do with anything?
Hey~!, what does that mean?
You know, we're both a little disappointed in you. You've let us down, Hisao.
Dropped the ball.
Left us hanging. And out in the cold~.
Is that any way to treat a person? To run away from your responsibilities, to abandon your comrades?
We think you owe it to us to honor your commitment.
That's not true, Hicchan! You said you are not useless, you definitely said it, yes, definitely, definitely definitely~!
We are calling you on those words now~! You better prepare to show you are not a useless guy!
Your honor will be soiled forever if you try to get out of this~!
So for the rest of the day, we are going to hang out together, just the three of us, and work hard!
You can't fool us!
You should be happy, you're doing your school a great service. Ask not what your school can do for you…
But what you can do for your school!
Hahaha!
Hahahahahahaha!
Cheer up, cheer up, Hicchan!
Besides, aren't you happy you get to spend the day with two cute girls?
Hahahaha!
She says you did a very good job. In fact, you might actually have a gift for this.
Wow, I'm impressed, too. And that was fast, have you done this before?
Well, our quota for the day is six stalls. In a few minutes, me and Shicchan should finish this one.
That means~… four more to go!
We're making good time, she says~!
Isn't this great fun?
Really, Hicchan?
Wahaha~! Shicchan thinks you are just running your mouth! Japanese people have no flight or fight reflex, Hicchan~!
Definitely~! Definitely, definitely~! If you really wanted to escape, you would have taken immediate action~! That is how you know someone is serious; when they have no doubts, no regrets!
Maybe it was a bad idea to tell you that, since now Hicchan knows what to do next time~.
Shicchan says she is happy now.
Yeah, the drinks are very cheap, too. We usually get something from there on days like this.
A hundred yen? You can get any drink in the machine with that.
Ah, wait a second.
Hm? What is it, Shicchan? Do you want him to get you a drink too? Hahaha!
Hicchan, you've really helped us out, so today I - I mean Shicchan, will treat you.
Hey, what about me?
What would you like? I'm feeling thirsty myself?
So am I!
Hey, wait, Shicchan! I also want a drink!
Aw…!
You know, it's times like this that I think she is just teasing me.
Yeah, she usually does. But… you never know…
Thanks, Shicchan~! I had total faith that you'd get me one, I knew I could count on you! Wahahaha!
But how did you know this was what I wanted? I usually get something else.
What? You knew I'd want to try it? And that I like these kinds of childish things? Hahahaha!
Hahahaha!
Hey, Hicchan…
We've been spending a lot of time together. Already, in such a short time, we've done so much.
We should both stop beating around the bush. What I'm trying to say is,
What I'm trying to say is…
Would you like to join the Student Council?
Hahaha! Hahahaha! Hahahahaha! Wahaha! Hahahaha!
Did you think she wanted to ask you out, Hicchan?
Hahahaha! Hahaha! Hahaha! Hahahaha!
Hahahahahahahaha!
So, how about it? All the paperwork is right here.
And you are sitting down, anyway. You look very at home here. Drinks and everything~!
What do you say?
Hicchan, what do you say?
You don't exactly hate this, right?
I think maybe you should join. Not just because we could use your help, but, well, you're hanging out with us anyway.
I think Shicchan would like it if you would join as well. It's not like you hate us or anything, right?
It wouldn't hurt if you joined. And I'd appreciate it if you would.
If you don't want to join, I promise we won't ask again, but if you did, we would be really happy.
Wonderful. Wonderful! Ahahaha~!
She'll fill everything out, Hicchan. Congratulations, you are officially a member of the Student Council now!
Congratulations, Hicchan!
Congratulations!
Congratulations!
Congratulations!
The Student Council is always busy, you know! But for today, we're done. See you tomorrow, Hicchan!
We still have work left, so we'll be counting on you!
Uwaaah! I'm so tired!
Well of course, we're in the Student Council, you know, so we're pretty busy.
It's an important duty of ours, to ensure the success of the festival with all our strength.
We would shame ourselves in front of the past student council generations if the festival were to fail.
That's why there must be no flaws, no… errr I think that was “incumbrances,” no nothing that might make the festival short of perfect.
Oh? Hello~!
Hey! Playing delinquent again?
Sorry, haven't seen Satou. She, eh, came by in the morning though.
If she has any sense in her head, she's in her classroom, working on their festival project. But who knows where that woman is loitering at.
What were we talking about? Oh yeah, we are really working hard to make the festival happen.
Hicchan!
How was your festival? Did you have fun?
Wahaha~, just asking, just asking!
Good morning~!
You don't look very energetic.
Cheer up a bit! It's a great day~!
Anyway, we were wondering if you're still interested in that student council position, because we're going to make an offer that you can't decline~
Not as such. But, wouldn't it be nice to hang out with us every day while also being useful to your school?
Is that so? Which club is it, Hicchan~?
Hicchan?
I think you need more practice.
Shicchan agrees.
What? Don't be silly~! There's no way that could be true.
You should learn to take constructive criticism better.
Tsk, tsk, Hicchan. Were you not listening to the teacher at all?
We have a group assignment, now.
So, what do you think of the lesson for today?
What are we going to do with you, Hicchan?
Didn't see you in the cafeteria, Hicchan.
Oh really? Are you sure you weren't participating in an illicit ren—dez—vous?
You were on the roof, right? With both Rin and Emi, no less! You Casanova, you!
Wahahaha! You're so adorable when you blush like that, Hicchan!
Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.
Oh?
Time will tell~!
Up on the roof again, Hicchan?
You know that's dangerous, don't you~?
That's right~!
The school cannot be held responsible for any injury that comes from being up there, you know!
Furthermore, we could report you for breaking the rules~!
But we won't, Hicchan!
You three are too cute together~!
Wahahaha~!
You're too easy to tease, Hicchan~!
Nope~!
It's to help you get acclimated to your new surroundings!
Yep!
Ah! That aside, Hicchan, we were looking for you this morning, but you weren't in your room!
That was because of student council business! You should be grateful that we work so hard for you~!
We had to give you something~ but since you weren't around, we dropped it off in your room!
Oh, you'll find out when you get back, Hicchan~! Wahahaha~!
Why Hicchan, you romantic, you~!
Did you confess on the rooftop? Did you~?
Young love is so unpredictable, isn't it~?
Ahaha~! Sorry, sorry, Shicchan~! Is there something you wanted from me?
Oh~… I see! Hm… That's a good question, Hicchan.
Oh, that's right! Everyone is encouraged to join a club. A lot of people do so because there isn't really anything else to do.
There are also school events, like the festival coming up in a few days. Almost every student in the school tends to help out with it, doing whatever.
So~! You actually transferred in at a busy time… maybe you can help out, too~!
…Wahahaha~! I don't know, Hicchan, the truth is it's a local event, and I'm not from this area, so…
Huh? Oh.
Who cares?
Human beings evolve with each new generation! The ideals and beliefs behind a festival will inevitably change with time!
Now, it's about delicious fried food and amusing little games that you play to win prizes~! Hahahaha~!
We are in the middle of class, and should start working.
That's right, Shicchan~!
What? That's right~! Hicchan, are you asking because you're interested in joining a club?
Hicchan? Is something wrong?
Okay~! Well, like we were asking, you don't have any plans for lunch today, do you?
Do you want to have lunch together then?
Yay~! Wahahaha~! Okay, Hicchan~! Perfect!
Yes it is, Hicchan!
Really?
Are you sure, Hicchan?
Hahaha! You're wrong, Hicchan. Because~!, I don't want to be the slowest one in the class. Therefore, what's on the line is my confidence in my abilities, and the prize is the satisfaction of proving them.
Wahahahaha~!
Where do you want to eat?
Hahaha~! That's so plain… Okay~! Let's go!
So, Hicchan, you wanted to know about clubs and stuff, right?, right~?
Right, Shicchan! Okay, I guess it makes sense to ask first.
Hicchan, do you have anything you're really interested in?
Hm… There is a book club, right, Shicchan? Right! But~! It seems like they have all the members they can possibly have right now. Sorry, Hicchan… It's a really popular club.
Ah, okay! But, more to the point, Hicchan, does this mean that you don't have anything already in mind?
Good! Great~! That's great, Hicchan! Really great! Hahaha~! Wahahahaha~!
No reason.
Well, Hicchan, other than clubs and the upcoming festival, there is one other thing…
Student Council!
Hahaha~! Hm? Right, right… Hicchan, maybe you should join the Student Council! They could use more people~. Yes! Definitely! You should definitely join!
Well, for one, we could hang out every day, Hicchan~! Shicchan and I are both in the Student Council.
Actually, Shicchan is the president.
Hahaha~! Of course, we're not trying to get you to join just because we would obviously benefit from you joining the Student Council and therefore have an incentive to try and get you to—
Ahaha~! No! We admit nothing~! I mean, Hicchan, of course it would be nice if you joined, and we'd appreciate it.
But even without all that, joining the Student Council shows a healthy interest in the workings of one's school.
Yup~! It's true, Hicchan. Besides, don't you want to spend time with us after school, Hicchan?
So it's settled, then. Welcome to the Student Council, Hicchan~!
Awww… See, Shicchan? Of course it wouldn't go so easily.
Yup! That's right, though, it would be boring if it went that smoothly. Oh well~! Shicchan owes me candy now!
Wahaha~! That's interesting, Hicchan. Let's play a game!
How about Rich Man, Poor Man, Hicchan? If you lose, you have to join the Student Council~!
Aw~, why not?
Yup!
Hicchan! I'm very offended! Are you saying you don't trust us, and that we would pull something so d—dis—in—gen—u—ous…? That makes me sad…
In order to atone for hurting a young girl's feelings, you should definitely join the Student Council!
How about a game of paper football, instead of Rich Man, Poor Man?
Yeah~! It's a game they play in America~! You make a paper triangle, and then you try to shoot it past goalposts that the other player makes with their fingers!
Isn't it cool~? It's the ultimate form of competition between two people, Hicchan~!
…And it's also played by elementary and middle school children, Shicchan? Wahaha! That means it's a game that really separates the boys from the men!
Hahaha~! Yeah yeah~, that's true! How did you know, Hicchan?
Okay, Hicchan, how about Risk? The game of world domination!
It's really fun, Hicchan. You fight for control of the world, with armies and everything.
If you want to play, we can after school.
Ah, really, Shicchan? We can play just for fun, Hicchan. Shicchan hasn't played in a long time, so if you want to, there are no strings attached~!
Okay! Okay, okay~! Perfect~! We'll see you after school in the student council room, then, Hicchan!
Because~! That's where we keep the game.
Wahahahaha~!
Wahahaha! What's wrong, Hicchan?
That's right, we're just going to go play a game of Risk, remember?
That's not true, Hicchan, Shicchan says that when their life is threatened, people have shown the capability to pull off superhuman bursts of speed.
Mm~ hm hm hm~…
No~.
Yeah, that's right~.
Hicchan, let's play Risk! Come on, you promised, didn't you? You have to~!
Hahaha~! Okay okay okay~! Do you want to know the rules? We can explain to you while we set everything up!
Hicchan, Shicchan wants you to know that you are taking too long to make a move.
Shicchan also says that she will let you keep Australia if you agree to join the Student Council~!
Shicchan admires your fighting spirit and would be a benevolent dictator who will spare your people if you agree to join the Student Council~!
Hahahaha~!
Mag—nan—i—mous…?
Ah, wait, please slow down, Shicchan… Um, Hicchan~! Shicchan says you're going to lose!
Ah… Okay…
Ahahaha, that's not important, Hicchan!
Oh? You're still in your pajamas, Hicchan? So you don't wake up at eight?
Then it's a good thing we came to wake you up!
Anyway, Hicchan, I guess you would like to know why we're here, wouldn't you?
Would you like to skip class and go somewhere nice with us?
Would you like to skip class to do something fun?
Well, it doesn't seem to be a problem! Hicchan, this school is pretty much at a standstill whenever this time rolls around.
It's a Saturday, too~. Don't you want to do something fun?
Not that we're pressuring you to give us your company, but we thought you might like to hang out!
So… would you like to join us? Come on, you'll have a lot more fun than just sitting here with your head on your desk~!
No, of course not!
And that's a really mean thing to just assume like that, Hicchan.
…And besides, you're in the Student Council now, remember?
If we wanted you to do something for us, we wouldn't have to trick you~!
Hahaha!
No tricks! Stop being so paranoid!
Eh? Why, Hicchan? You look just fine!
So, we're planning on slipping into town! Remember that tea shop we were at on Wednesday?
You don't remember?
Tea shop! It's called the Shanghai. China is the birthplace of tea, you know. Come on, Hicchan! I'll even treat you today!
Ah… not me, not me, I mean Shicchan! Ahaha~!
It's nice, it's really relaxing! It's like… half café, half restaurant, half sophisticated, half… library…
So~! Come on, it's not often that we have this much free time!
If you're busy, though, you don't have to! It's not like your presence is absolutely, absolutely required!
Hahahaha!
Great~!
No, this is kind of weird. Hey, this isn't a bad thing though, right?
Nope!
So, Hicchan, have you decided what you're going to order?
Tea!
Clearly~!
Well played, Hicchan, but~ we already ordered!
We're regulars, we come here so often that we don't have to do that any more!
Well, I guess you've had enough. We're sitting on the menus, of course~!
Hahaha!
You can take one if you want, but you're not the kind of person who would do something that la—sci—vious?, isn't that right?
Coffee? This is a very high class establishment, and you're going to order coffee?
Hicchan, Shicchan is drinking a special tea that is only grown in remote areas of India.
The tea is still handmade by a tribe of tea makers who have passed the methods down in their families for generations.
They must wade through alligator-infested waters to obtain the leaves once a year. On each trip, some do not make it back alive.
I don't know what I'm drinking.
Hicchan, do you have any plans for tomorrow?
Okay, Hicchan, if you're that busy. We don't have anything to do tomorrow, so we thought maybe you would want to hang out with us at the festival!
You're new here, anyway, right? Right? So~ we thought we would show you around and have some fun together, but if you're that busy, we understand!
Oh well, oh well!
Ahahahahaha~!
Hicchan, you're so paranoid.
…And you'll never beat me anyway, so why bother getting so worked up about it?
Haha! Wow, Shicchan~!
You know~! …Eh? Do you, Hicchan? Because I don't.
You can't outwit me! —Ah, well, Hicchan, not me…
What? What are you talking about, Shicchan…
Don't you have to follow through to make good on that, Hicchan?
You won't~.
Let's make a wager on it, then!
That's okay if you don't know, neither do I! Wahahaha!
So it's settled, then! All right, all right!
Now all that's left is the stakes! What the winner wins, or, more interestingly, what the loser loses!
Never?
So you have never gambled, Hicchan?
Oh, come on… It's just for fun, anyway! Between friends~!
It's about causing humiliation, suffering, and absolute despair! Isn't that the point?
Hm… Ah, how about this, Hicchan: If you lose, you have to go to school one day without any pants on.
It's not like you could match my wager if we did~! Now, it's your turn! …But nothing perverted! Understand?
Hahaha!
Okay~! Come on, you should both hurry up, your drinks are getting cold!
Hicchan, are you sure you don't want to hang out tomorrow? A lot of people are looking forward to it; you don't want to miss out.
I don't really understand…
Well, Hicchan, it'd be really nice if we could all celebrate how well we put everything together for the festival by taking a look at our handiwork…
You too, Shicchan?
Why are you two acting so weird?
Hahaa! Just the person we were waiting for. So you made it here eventually, Hicchan, good! Now it's time for work work work~!
We sort of need your help~!
We need your help~!
You will help us!
Really? Is it?
Eh? It is?
Ah, sorry, Hicchan, I guess it is! Hahahaha!
I thought we had almost everything done by now, but it turns out we have all these signs to attach to backing boards.
More hands make light work!
And everybody wins! Hahahahaha!
This is your duty, after all, as a member of the Student Council. Which you are a part of.
As a member.
Of the Student Council.
Ahahaha~!
It's a simple task, so getting it out of the way now would be good. It's not that much work. A small thing, really!
And we'd really appreciate your help!
Really, really appreciate it!
Besides, it's time to pay back for us treating you so nicely!
Don't say that, it was completely unrelated. We wanted to celebrate you joining the council!
No buts! You're coming with us!
Ah, I don't think you have a choice in this, Hicchan! Hahahaha!
There are two of us, so don't even try to get away, now! Don't take us lightly!
Hicchan, it's your duty to help us, anyway! As a member of the Student Council!
Like who, Hicchan?
You were fine with helping us yesterday…
That's what we'd like to know! …Aha… Ahahahahaha!
That's my Hicchan! I knew we could trust you~!
So predictable~.
Hahaha~! Really? Well, there are a lot of them, so maybe…
Eh? No?
How do you know that, Shicchan?
Really?
Ahaha! That's… irrelevant, Hicchan! Can you get on with making the signs, please?
Ah, well, Shicchan meant it wouldn't be that much work for us.
Someone has to supervise you while you do this, you know, to make sure you're doing it right. And those people will be us.
Watch you! Hahahaha~!
No, that was just a joke, Hicchan. We'll help out too, of course. The Student Council is really supposed to have a lot more people.
This is just a bad year. Fewer people than usual, even though we already didn't have many the year before.
And then there's just a lot more work than before, too.
Besides, Shicchan likes working with you. And so do I!
We've accomplished a lot more than we normally could, you know.
So you're out too, Hicchan? Don't worry, Shicchan says she'll get some more.
Hahahaha!
We went through a box too, but me and Shicchan decided to wait until you needed a new box as well before getting a new one.
Ah, well, actually, Hicchan, we ran out twenty minutes ago, and there was only one spare box of tacks, the ones we gave to you.
And you were flying through those pretty quickly, so~! we thought that we should wait until we both had no more tacks before getting more!
Then, Shicchan could go get fresh boxes of tacks for all of us at the same time. You know, for efficiency~!
Ahaha~! Nothing, of course! What could we do? We had no tacks, Hicchan!
Oh, we know it was clever.
The both of us, of course, of course!
Ahahaha~! Well, Hicchan, it was all Shicchan's idea.
Why?
You would be surprised, Hicchan.
Haha… Sorry, Hicchan, it's not anything like that, even if it would be cuter that way.
When I came to this school, they just placed me next to Shicchan, and she looked like a very serious person.
And I thought, “I'm going to be spending the rest of the year next to this person, maybe!”
“So it would be nice if we could be friends! But~, I wonder if she'll like me.”
And I learned that she was deaf. You know, Hicchan, the first time I just thought she was ignoring me~!
But, luckily, I knew a little sign language, and we became friends.
Now, I guess we're always together. It's nice, I've always wanted someone to listen to me, and I think Shicchan likes having someone to talk to! So, everybody wins.
That's it? You look disappointed, Hicchan, what were you expecting?
Ahahahahaha!
You know, Hicchan, I don't think that me and Shicchan thanked you properly.
Joining the Student Council. You've been a real help to us, Hicchan! I think I will get a lot more sleep now~!
That's an interesting thing to say, Hicchan.
Shicchan really appreciates you helping us out too.
Ah, Shicchan.
It was just very hard to get these…
I guess that is an understatement, Shicchan…
It really wasn't a big deal in retrospect? That's forward thinking of you!
All right then, I guess the two of us should get back to work, Hicchan!
That's all for today, I guess! That's a good thing, Shicchan, I'm very tired, too.
You agree? Hahaha, we didn't expect it to take so long either! Not as planned!
Aww, I'm so hungry. I just realized I haven't eaten all day.
This can't be happening! Hicchan, can you think of any way we could… obtain food?
Why not order out? Oh, that's right, I guess I could do that.
From town, of course!
Maybe some Chinese food!
Ahahaha~! Hicchan, you should have just said so in the first place!
What's that? It's your treat? That's great! That's great!
Wahaha, that's true, if it wasn't for you, we wouldn't be here so late, Shicchan!
What do you want, Hicchan?
Ahahahahaha~!! Hicchan, Shicchan is paying for everything tonight, it's all on her, so you can afford to splurge a little!
All right, all right! And you, Shicchan?
A Chinese omelette? Okay, then.
Sure! Haha! Like this, like this…
And this is for what you ordered: Dumplings!
Shrimp fried rice!
I'm going to get soup and a stir-fry, you say that like this…
And here's how much it all costs: 3685 yen!
Ahahahaha! Okay~! I'm going to order now, unless anyone wants something else. No objections? All right all right, then!
This isn't the first time we've ordered out, Hicchan, and they always give us a ton of chopsticks, for some reason, even when we tell them we're only two people.
That's exactly it! Hahahahahaha!
I'm overstating it?
Haha! That's right, Shicchan! Hey, Hicchan, did you know that once we've collected a hundred pairs of chopsticks from ordering out, we'll be able to take over the universe?
Hicchan, are you good at breaking them down the middle? I can never do it right, so I found the little pile of chopsticks Shicchan had saved up and practiced on at least twenty of them.
She was really mad about that!
Hicchan~…
Help me~…
Help me, help me, help me~…
Shicchan's going to be fine, but I think I might die. Am I going to die, Hicchan? Will you let me die from all this work?
Studying's too boring to waste a holiday on, Hicchan! Shopping together was much more fun, wasn't it, Shicchan?
But you went anyway? It's so rare to see a guy that likes going shopping~…
Of course, Hicchan. It's only sensible to study in the days before…
U~rgh.
Oh, ah, so what did you do over the weekend, Hicchan?
Hmm~…
Whoever you date is your business. I hope you two go well together.
Hicchan~!
Well~…
Shicchan and I were thinking~…
Since we're just two poor little girls that need help with all the work we've been given just before the holidays begin~…
But Hicchan, we're really nee—
What?
So you'll help us, Hicchan?
Everything, Hicchan!
What's left on the desks is what needs to be done.
It all needs to be digitally recorded, which is what the laptop is for.
Shicchan says she saw you with the computers in the library a few days ago, and that you seemed really good with them~.
One must know their allies before they can know their enemies, of course~.
Wow, that's pretty wise…
Besides, it will help to take your mind off things~.
I was just thinking you may like to get your mind off the exams, of course~.
That's the spirit, Hicchan~!
Ah, you're here~.
Of course!
And I've been here during all of lunchtime as well!
But aren't you the one always outsourcing work to your classmates~?
Tyranny works~! Even if we did things differently, we still got the same results, right~?
You have to seize power, it's not as good if it's just handed to you~! But I guess you wouldn't really understand that, right~?
You'll also have to remind me when monarchs were elected into their positions~.
But Hisao volunteered~! He's such a hard worker, he's doing this instead of meaningless socialization, right~?
Hicchan, you make that sound like it's a regular occurrence~…
What's up?
Okie dokie!
We couldn't just take off without you, Hicchan, you've been a great help!
I'll miss you, Lilly. I think it was fun working with you.
Shizune says… you'd better do your work over there better than you did it here.
Shicchan says that she'll be checking to make sure you live up to your end of the promise.
'Morning~! Shicchan says that Mutou wants to see you sometime.
Wahahaha~! Anyone'd think you were in trouble, Hicchan!
You may not be aware of it, but you have the least to worry about out of anyone in the class.
And what might that be, Hicchan?
I would say that such matters aren't relevant to you, but since you seem to have befriended Lilly…
While I assume the same of her, I cannot call my own views on the matter unbiased. Suffice to say, we were closer before than we are now.
Shicchan says you should ask Lilly about it, as she doesn't want to be the one that gets you involved.
Hicchan~, it looks like we're together again! Yay yay~!
What's wrong, Hicchan?
Oh… Hicchan, have you been thinking about what you said yesterday? You said that you would think about joining the Student Council, didn't you?
It's okay, Hicchan. We were talking about it after you left, and it would be rude to expect you to already have an answer for us this early, right? Right~!
Hahahahahaha~!
Huh? Who, Hicchan?
I think so, Hicchan. Do you feel sorry for her because she's alone?
Hmmmm… No, I don't think that would be a good idea, Hicchan.
Shicchan wouldn't get along with her.
Just because, Hicchan.
What, Shicchan? The friend of my enemy is my enemy? That sounds so harsh, I'm not going to say that.
I know, Hicchan, it's fine if you overhear~!
Anyway, we should start on the problems now, Hicchan.
Oh, sorry Hicchan! Were you waiting for us?
You don't have any plans?
For lunch?
If you don't have anything specific planned out, do you want to eat lunch with me and Shicchan? Ah, we're going to go to town for lunch, though… Don't worry, Hicchan, it's not that far.
Miss Ibarazaki, I saw that. Running in the halls is strictly forbidden.
You've been told this a thousand times before. Your reckless behavior endangers other students, and even worse, it's explicitly against the school regulations.
Make sure that this will not happen again… although I'm sure telling you this is futile, and only causes me further headache when you choose to ignore the regulations.
Got that, Emi?
Are you okay, Hicchan? That Ibarazaki girl is always like that, causing trouble to others.
Never mind, never mind!
That's great, Hicchan!
So, let's hurry, Hicchan~! To have lunch!
We promise it'll be great!
It's a teahouse, Hicchan~!
Why are you looking at your wallet, Hicchan? It's okay, if you don't have any money we'll cover for you~!
It's okay, Hicchan! After all, we're friends, right, Hicchan?
Ah, it's only for today, though, and only if you accept right now! Do you want to go, Hicchan?
That's great, Hicchan~! That's great, that's great! Yay~!
Oh? I wasn't aware that Hicchan was a king. Hahahaha~!
We have to run now, there is an important student council meeting regarding the festival. And we finally decided where to eat~!
Too bad you can't join, but this lunch meeting is only for council members.
We can take you there some other time! Oh, but that'd be like a date, wouldn't it?
Wahaha~!
Hi, Yuu-chan~!
Of course, Hicchan~! Yuu-chan works in the library, after all~! I don't go there often myself, but Shicchan knows her! And~!, we both come here a lot, so it's like we see her all the time!
Okay, okay~! That works for Shicchan! Yuu-chan, please get Shicchan what she usually gets, and I'll have some green tea with milk and honey.
It's okay, Yuu-chan, Hicchan didn't order anything, so it's not your fault, don't be upset.
Hicchan, just how much money do you have in your wallet? It can't be that little, right?, right? We should split the cost three ways, to make it fair~! Yeah, I won't accept anything else~!
Yuu-chan, Shicchan says she wants three of whatever is the most expensive item on the menu~.
Hahaha~! Just kidding, Hicchan…
Hicchan, have you thought about joining the Student Council?
Don't talk with your mouth full, Hicchan…
A man should be decisive, Hicchan!
You really should join the Student Council, Hicchan. Come on, it'll be fun!
Don't you believe me, Hicchan?
Hicchan, that's depressing. We just want to spend time with you…
That's right, Shicchan! Yeah, that's a good point too!
Yup, this is beneficial to everyone, it solves all our problems~.
Yeah, I also thought Hicchan would appreciate it… That makes me sad.
Aw, but it's true, Hicchan~! And you would be helping us out, membership has been really low this year.
Ah, that's a secret, Hicchan.
Ahaha…
Well…
Wahaha~! Hicchan, that isn't important. What matters is that the number is low, and that is why we would appreciate you giving us a hand, especially with the festival coming up so soon, and it looking to be a busy year ahead in general.
No~.
Um, well, Hicchan, we're definitely undermanned, but we have enough members to get the job done. Yup, yup~!
Hahaha~! Hicchan, that's funny~!
But~! It's definitely not just us.
Yup~!
Hicchan, your two cute student council representatives have been trying to make you feel welcome and are even treating you to lunch. You should show your gratitude by joining the council so you can at least help them out.
Yeah, it would be great if you could just file some papers for us, and… the festival is coming up, and we have to build some stalls for the games and food, just a few, so if you were there, it would be a lot easier for us…
Please, Hicchan?
…?
Hmm~… Sorry, Hicchan, I can't tell you.
No, Hicchan, I can't tell you because~!, it means something nice.
Something wrong, Hicchan?
 Yup~! You are already late.
Hicchan is so moral…
But~! Hicchan is right, he is late for class, and~ it looks like you're cutting too, Hicchan, because you're not making an effort to go.
As your student council representatives, we're going to have to do something about this and make sure you're punished for it~!
Hicchan, we were just taking a prospective student council member out to try and recruit him. It's business, business~! But~! You're not a member of the council, so there's no excuse!
Yes~! Are you going to join the Student Council, Hicchan?
Hicchan, if only you were a member of the Student Council… But~! You can still join now, Hicchan! If you join now, you won't be in any trouble at all, and we'll be able to take many more nice excursions like this all the time! It'll be fun~!
By the way, Hicchan, I didn't plan this at all, things just happened to work out this way~!
Ahahahaha~! You look so nervous, Hicchan~! Did you really think we were tricking you this whole time?
Hicchan, you really thought…?
Shicchan says she's flattered, Hicchan, but doing that kind of thing would be a grossly inappropriate abuse of power, and imposing on your free will~! And~! It would be blackmail, too! Shicchan would never do anything like that, never!
Anyway, Hicchan, what Shicchan said is true. Since you're with us, and we're doing student council work, it's okay if we miss a class or two.
Not that this is a good excuse to do so…
…Or one that should be used more than three times a month…
Or something that can or should be abused…
So~! We must definitely, definitely return to class! Eventually~!
Wahaha~!
Hi, Hicchan~! Guess who!
Hahaha~! It is!
Hicchan, are you busy right now?
Hicchan, could you please go upstairs and get a few things for us from the art room?
Hahaha~! Shicchan thinks that if the art teacher sees us, he will say hi, and she doesn't like him!
She tried, but even though Shicchan is deaf, he'll try to say “hi~!” anyway!
I never run!
Stairs make me dizzy, Hicchan!
Please, Hicchan? We need these things to build stalls for the festival, and you said you would help out a little, right?, right?
That's great, Hicchan! Thank you~!
This is what we need!
Teacher~!
Yes~?
Yes~!
I… we need help! We are running out of supplies for the festival stands!
This is a distress!
Plywood! Plywood is always the problem! Last time we wanted more there was only a little, but that time we just took it all and went with that.
Now there's like none left there, so do you know where there is some?
Shicchan… I mean the president thought that a teacher would know if there is plywood. Was she wrong?
Awww… what should I do?
Aaaah! I don't have time! We are so busy!
I shouldn't even be fetching these things, there is so much to do and we are falling behind the schedule!
You can? Thanks, Hicchan, you are really nice!
Come to think of it, what's Hicchan doing here? Class is over, you should be having fun~!
Oh no! It's not detention is it? Are you in trouble, Hicchan?
Is Hicchan in trouble, teacher?
Here's a list. I can try to find the plywood from somewhere if there's none in the art room.
Awww….
Still, thanks, Hicchan. Try to be quick, we are in a stall-building streak now, we must hurry hurry hurry!
What did she hear?
No wait, more importantly, who is in there? There's no club meetings today.
You took so long that we had to come check what's wrong. That's no good, Hicchan~.
I found plywood, but everything else is still missing because you are tardy.
I think you were up to some mischief, Hicchan~! Who was in there with you, I wonder…
Miss Tezuka, what do you think you were doing? You absolutely are not permitted to use school property for such… err, disgraceful? activity!
Popularity aside, please don't do that any more.
Anyway, how is your project going? Will it be done for the festival?
And…?
Miss Tezuka, please try to take this seriously. It'll be a disaster if the wall looks like someone threw up their lunch onto it.
Huh~?
Caviar? Surgeon?
What?
Sorry, Shicchan, I think I'll pass for today.
Sorry, I'm just not hungry right now.
Shicchan, that's impossible to know~.
Hm~, but it's easy, so it's ok, right~?
I thought about it, and~… I don't do enough work when I work with you and Shicchan! So, I'm going to try harder today. So~!, don't distract me, Hicchan~. I have to stay focused~.
…
Can't it wait until later, Hicchan?
We're in the middle of class~…
Why do you and Shicchan keep asking me if I want to eat something~? ~Hicchan?
Is this about the Student Council?
Shicchan, is that all you ever think about?
Surprise~, Hicchan~! Were you looking for me? I had a feeling~!
The Shanghai~.
Okay, then, Hicchan.
Why are you both doing this, Hicchan?
…
No, Hicchan. I told you that.
That's stupid. Shicchan isn't that stupid, Hicchan. Don't be ridiculous~.
It wasn't a fight, Hicchan. It was just me yelling at her.
Hm~. No she doesn't, Hicchan.
That doesn't make sense…
Wahaha~.
Hicchan, do you remember when I said I didn't want to hate Shicchan, or upset her? The truth is~, I ended up doing both. Now it's like there's, like, an awkwardness between us. It's hard to explain.
I screwed up already, Hicchan. It'll happen again~, I'm sure. When I think about it that way, I don't know what I'm supposed to do. It feels like either way, I'll end up making things worse. Then, it might be better if I didn't do anything at all, right~?
Hicchan~, I never knew you were so optimistic. I never expected it.
You always act so gloomy when I try and surprise you.
Haha~.
“Now,” huh~…?
Where are we going now?
I remember that, Hicchan. But~, I know where all of these places are, too.
Yeah~.
No.
“That's all~.”
Friend, hm~…
Aren't you my friend, too, Hicchan?
Ahahaha~.
Why're you doing this, Hicchan?
I'm not stupid.
That's the only reason?
That's it?
Wahaha~. You can, you can~, but~, I want to know.
Definitely~. You can't take it too seriously~! If you aren't always thinking big, thinking positive, and if you show any signs of weakness, people will start to think you're incompetent, you know~.
And soon you won't be able to do anything because your power is going to be delegated off to others piece by piece, and you'll be left with nothing. That's what happened last time~.
So~! Remember~, it may seem like an easy job, but a lot of carnage can happen in this room. Ahaha~. And~, out of it. Dealing with school staff, too! Even trying to get a budget report from a class rep can be a fight to the death~, sometimes.
Eh?
Hm~… I'd be happier if I didn't have to leave, too.
I like being in the Student Council, even if it can be tiring, too.
Only because Shicchan is always trying to do more than she has to~.
Ahaha~.
Shicchan was wrong~, though.
Hmmm~, I agree, it's too early. Plus~, I don't think I could go anyway. Sorry~! In fact, I was going to leave right now.
No~ comment~!
Well… okay~!
I thought about it, and~… Even if I didn't want to go, I would say yes~! Usually~. It's the kind of person I am. I really should stop doing that, and this is a good place to start, I think.
If it's a celebration to say goodbye, I don't want it. It would be too sad~. I want to do something else instead. And after all, Hicchan, you and Shicchan will still be here tomorrow. It doesn't seem right.
Besides, I have other school things I have to do today~! I can't drop them just like that.
No. No early goodbyes~!
Hm~? Oh, that's right~! Wahaha~!
Okay, besides now, no too-early goodbyes, okay?
Okay, later~!
I'm not throwing it~, when I get nervous, I like to spin it around, but~, then I forget I'm holding onto it, and—
R-right~! Sorry.
Hi, Hicchan~! I'm surprised to see you here~!
You first~.
Me, too~! I thought she would be here, but I got Hicchan instead~!
Wahaha! Well~, this is good. Really, really~. I wanted to talk to you, anyway~.
I wanted to say sorry~, of course~, for all the trouble I made for you and Shicchan.
Right~, right~.
Ahaha~. Right~, right~. But that isn't why I'm here, Hicchan. I wouldn't apologize to Shicchan. Since you're here, I want to ask you a question.
Hicchan, what do you think it would take for Shicchan to be happy?
Wahaha~!
Even though you're joking, Hicchan~… No, even if she could, it wouldn't make Shicchan happy. Only for a little while.
Hicchan, have you ever heard of artists who tear up their paintings as soon as they finish them? Such people really exist in the world, you know~!
I remembered it all of a sudden. It's just like Shicchan, now that I think about it. Whenever Shicchan sets up a challenge for herself and completes it, she acts like her skills have no meaning any more.
I wonder~, is it because she can't create anything permanent?
It's just like those artists, and how they want to create a piece of art to leave behind~, a really great one~, but can't do it. It's really obvious when I look back at it~, but~, I didn't see it before. Now, I'm scared. I wonder if Shicchan will ever be happy.
Before, I still thought… hm~… I might be able to make Shizune happy; and I was in a good place to do it before. Since I was her interpreter, I could always be with her. Maybe…
And~, I thought I would do it by becoming like… Shicchan's shadow.
I kept trying even when she rejected me. It felt like I was stuck and I couldn't do anything but watch Shicchan's back getting smaller while she kept going. I was scared, even though I should have just accepted it.
It's hard. Maybe I could have at least understood Shicchan~.
But it looks like I was completely wrong after all~… I didn't even know that, or think about it… Shicchan would call it a complete loss.
Okay~, I'm done. That's it, Hicchan~. But~! Since you're the one who knows Shicchan best of all, you can't make her cry. Or I'll be angry~!
I'm going to go overseas after this. I even have letters of recommendation, or I don't think I would be able to normally~! Maybe I'll study and become a sign language teacher over there? Who knows~!
That means~! You have to look after Shicchan, okay?
Hi~ hi~!
What are you doing~?
That's obvious~!
That happened to me in elementary school, only it was with candy~!
Hicchan, make a peace sign~!
Did you see Shicchan around here~?
Wahaha~! It was~ a busy week.
What did the new Student Council want, Shicchan~?
Hm~? What does that mean, Shicchan?
Ahahaha~!
I don't like this pose either, but I think it's kind of nice~.
Now, let's get one with Yuuko, too~!
A Student Council member should know that~!
Right~!
You were looking for me, Hicchan?
Hm~… Who knows~? I think it's just coincidence.
Hahaha~.
I didn't get to eat at lunchtime, so yeah~! But~, not too much, so I can still have dinner.
Did you want to talk to me about something, Hicchan?
I wanted to ask you the same thing, Hicchan~.
Well~, except, she's been this way for a couple of days now.
Hicchan, do you think it's because of something I did? Do you think I got upset at Shicchan, like last time?
Hicchan~! You want to work together? Okay, okay~! That's great! It's really been a while~!
Good afternoon, Hanako~!
Shicchan says, if you're looking for a group, you can join ours~!
I guess we get to play again, Hicchan~! You hardly ever play with us any more…
That hurt, Hicchan… I'd almost think you were insulting me~!
But~! It's Hicchan, so I know that you're joking!
Wahaha~!
Hi, Hanako~! It's nice to finally work with you~.
Are you the reason Hicchan has been avoiding us, lately~? Shicchan says it's a little rude, but if Hicchan wanted to spend time with a cute girl, it's understandable~!
Really~? So~! He wasn't hanging out with you yesterday?
Really~? I wonder what was so important, for Hicchan to blow us off like that~! If it wasn't to spend time with Hanako, then what could it be~? It's really interesting…
Suspicious~! Hicchan~! I demand that you explain yourself!
But~! It's so mysterious… Even Hanako wants to know~!
Hanako? I'm sorry…
Hey, Hanako, do you understand this~?
Hanako? Are you sure you're okay?
Hanako, you're being too quiet~. You have to contribute, too~! Someday, we might work on a bigger project, like one that's so big it's worth celebrating afterwards, like with ice cream, or cake. If you act like this, we won't take you along~!
Hicchan, it's all in good fun~! Shicchan says she teases everyone, anyway.
Hicchan~! You sound a little like Shicchan, there…
Did… did we upset her…?
Hello… is anybody in there~?
Ah! There we are! Welcome back to Earth, Hicchan~!
You keep on dazing off into space; I was beginning to think that you might be trying to contact alien life.
Hey, are you really all right? Yesterday kinda rattled me as well…
Did you see her last night?
Er… I think what Shicchan is trying to say is “you're welcome.”
What's so funny, Hicchan~? Was it something we said?
Wahahaha~! You're right~! Shicchan is really cute when she tries not to be!
Oh~? Okay… Hicchan, Shicchan wants you to come and have dinner with us.
Awww…
Oh well. It's your choice, Hicchan.
Well hello there, Hicchan. It's nice to see you again today~!
Not feeling well yesterday, Hicchan~?
That's good to know, Hicchan.
Oh no, Hicchan, we're genuinely pleased that you're all better now~.
In fact, we were quite worried about you. After all…
You, Hanako and Lilly were all absent from class on the same day.
It's a bit late for that, Hicchan~.
The only reason why we're giving you such a hard time is that you ignored us yesterday morning~!
It was, and you left us there for ages after we'd taken all the effort of coming to your dormitory early in the morning.
This is what we were trying so hard to give you, Hicchan! You don't check your…
I should think so, after what we went through to get it to you~.
